\section*{Buy vs Build}

There's not a lot to this, really. We decided to buy instead of build because it worked better with our budget and timeline. We needed to have a home in NoVA by August 2023, which was based on when my oldest daughter started kindergarten. As we talked to more builders, we burnt up resources and had to face the reality that building a custom home was time-consuming and expensive. I was not willing to sacrifice our timeline because it meant impacting my daughter's education. It started making a lot of sense to stop trying to build and instead find a nice house. 

And finding a nice house in Loudoun County is pretty easy! Buying our current home only took eight weeks working with a great husband and wife realtor team who support one of the builders we met. It was a fraction of the cost, and it is very similar to what we would have built anyway. We closed in May 2023, three months ahead of when we wanted to be in NoVA, and I had a place to stay just in time for the return to office mandate at Amazon. It was extremely convenient, even though we'll have to plant a new forest on this property, and we have some customization to do.
