\section*{Section example}


Begin the story in the September care meeting at the hospital. Talk about Dad sharing feelings and predicting his death. Fast forward to December 20th & 21st, mention the call after Christmas, then go to New Year's Eve and the hospital stay. End this part of the story on his exit from the hospital and his death 12 days later.

His 17 days in the hospital were some of the longest days of my life.

And then what? Funeral and burial wishes.

Paperwork and the life thereafter...
