\textit{In my \href{https://jayjaybillings.com/2023/07/06/outliving-your-mind-part-1-the-secret/}{last post} on my father's battle with dementia, I shared how his symptoms progressed over time. In this post, I'll talk about how families can get help.}

Key narrative points:
1. In an ideal world, there's tons of help for dementia.
2. We like to think everyone is prepared and going to be in that ideal world, but the truth is an enormous amount of people are fucked and never do anything about end-of-life health care or estate planning.
3. Dad never prepared for anything - he was in the second group.

ROCKING CHAIRS!!!!

\section*{Next Time}

Thanks for reading the third part of my series about my father’s struggles with cognitive decline and what we did to help him. I hope you’ll come back to read the next part, in which I'll discuss... 

I would especially like to thank my wonderful wife Paige for her support, Paige and my friend Brandon Nipper for their reviews of my draft, Michael Phelan for encouraging me to finish this article, and those who reached out after the earlier articles with kind words of encouragement and gratitude.
